# EHR_DatabaseProject

This project demonstrates how to manage healthcare-related data (Electronic Health Records) using both **structured** (MySQL) and **non-structured** (MongoDB) databases. It includes various SQL queries, stored procedures, and MongoDB operations to illustrate real-world scenarios such as CRUD operations, handling transactions, working with joins, and more.

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: Provide a sample Electronic Health Record (EHR) database setup with operations in both MySQL and MongoDB.
- **Scope**: Showcases fundamental and advanced database features:
  - **MySQL**: CRUD operations, stored procedures, joins, transactions, and various insert queries.
  - **MongoDB**: Sample queries for handling non-structured healthcare data.

The primary goal is to give an example of how healthcare systems can store and manage patient data, prescriptions, vitals, and other related information using both relational and NoSQL approaches.
